# Instrument_Three
A violin-inspired accessible musical instrument.

Instrument Three was designed in collaboration with physically disabled musician Marylouise McCord and The OHMI Trust. This instrument is inspired by the violin but can be played with one hand through the use of four touch-sensors. With support from OHMI, Marylouise used the instrument in a series of private violin lessons with music tutor Gemma McGrath.
